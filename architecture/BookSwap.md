# Book Swap

A small used book store wants to differentiate themselves and drive traffic to their store by facilitating book swap events.
They want a website that will allow people to know when each event will be held and let each other know what books they want to give or receive.
The book store will give out discount coupons to attendees based on how many books they give away.

Requirements:
* The book store employees can schedule book swap events which then show on the website.
* Customers can indicate:
    * whether they will attend the event
    * what books they have to give away
    * what books they would like to receive
* Book store employees can verify swaps and view how many swaps customers have made over time.
  * (They will use this data to decide how to give out coupons.)

Additional context:
* The book store has a limited budget for the initial build, but if it is successful they have many ideas for future features.
* The store already has a decent social media presence, but no existing website.
* There are only 10 full-time employees, and a varying number of part-time employees.
